# ADASHIP - Assignment 2

AdaShip is a clone of the classic ‘Battleship’ game – as a default, AdaShip is a two-player, turn based game of sea warfare. You and an opponent each place a number of ships on your own board, and you then alternate turns "firing" torpedoes at each other’s ships. The game is won when one player has destroyed/sunk all of the other player’s ships.

## 1. Challenge Outline

### 1.1. Summary

AdaShip is a clone of the classic ‘Battleship’ game – as a default, AdaShip is a two-player, turn based game of sea warfare. The object of AdaShip is to try and sink all of the other player's boats before the opponent sinks all your ships. All of the opponent’s ships are somewhere placed on their board.  You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The opponent also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates. The board will record ‘hit’ or ‘miss’, if either player makes contact with the positions of the boats. Neither you nor the opponent can see the other's player’s board or their placed ships, therefore you must try to guess where their ships has been placed and attack accordingly. The game ends when one player wins by sinking all of their opponent’s boats
